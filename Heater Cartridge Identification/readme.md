# Heater Cartridge Identification
How to distinguish common 3D Printer heater cartridges

## How to read

Using a multimeter, select ohms (resistance) and use your test leads to the two wires (or connector pins) on the cartridge.

### Common Readings:

1) 12V 40W Cartridges typically read around 3.6 ohms
2) 24V 40W Cartridges typically read around 13.5 to 14.4 ohms

## How to estimate appropriate readings
We can determine the appropriate values by manipulating two formulas.

### Ohm's Law
Electric current is proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to resistance.

V = I x R

V = Voltage (Volts)
I = Current (Amps)
R = Resistance (Ohms)

### Power Equation
Electric current is proportional to power and inversely proportional to voltage.

P = I Ã— V

P = Power (Watts)
I = Current (Amps)
V = Voltage (Volts)
